MVC

1) 
    The browser issues a request for the /users/1/edit URL.
    Rails routes /users/1/edit to the index action in the Users controller.
    The index action asks the User model to retrieve user's 1 edit page.
    The User model pulls user's 1 from the database.
    The controller captures the user's 1 edit page in the @users variable, which is passed to the index view.
    The view uses embedded Ruby to render the page as HTML.
    The controller passes the HTML back to the browser.

2) _edit.html.erb
